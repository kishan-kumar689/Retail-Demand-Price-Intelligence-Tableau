📊 Retail Demand & Price Intelligence Dashboard (Tableau)

An executive-level Tableau dashboard designed to analyze retail demand, pricing dynamics, and supplier risk across categories and countries.

This project replicates how global retail and sourcing teams monitor:

Revenue growth

Pricing (ASP) trends

Supplier performance

Margin and operational risk

🚀 Business Problem

Retailers need to understand:

Whether revenue growth is driven by higher demand or price increases

Which product categories drive seasonality

Which suppliers are high-risk and low-margin

This dashboard answers those questions using interactive KPI cards, dual-axis trends, and risk-profitability matrices.

🧠 Key Insights

Revenue growth is primarily driven by Apparel and Footwear, with strong Q4 seasonality

ASP trends show moderate pricing pressure across product categories

High-risk, low-margin suppliers are concentrated in select sourcing countries and require strategic action
